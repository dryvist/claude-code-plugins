  Work with repositories using the git-flow-next branching model (default branch is `develop`, production branch is `main`). Covers branch creation, worktree setup, atomic commits, PR targeting, validation on `develop`, and mandatory end-of-session promotion to `main`.

# git-flow-next Usage Guide

Use this skill when working on repositories configured for the Git Flow branching model.

## 1. Detect Adoption First

Before any branch, PR, or release work, check the repo's remote default branch:

```bash
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

- If default branch is `develop` -> Follow this skill.
- If default branch is `main` -> Use trunk flow (squash-to-main directly). Do NOT follow this skill.
- Never infer adoption from the current local branch name.

## 2. The Branching Model

| Branch | Role | Gets changes by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | Production. Protected; no direct pushes. | **Merge commits only** — squash and rebase are banned. |
| `develop` | Default integration branch. | Squash-merged feature PRs (default); merge commits for back-merges. |
| `feature/<issue>-<slug>` | Topic work | Branched from fresh `develop`. |
| `release/<version>` | Release stabilization | Branched from `develop`; merge-committed to `main`; back-merged to `develop`. |
| `hotfix/<slug>` | Production fix | Branched from `main`; PR to `main` (merge commit); back-merged to `develop`. |

## 3. Dedicated Worktree Setup

All feature development happens in dedicated worktrees. To prevent wrong nesting:

1. Resolve the destination path using an absolute anchor:

   ```bash
   git worktree add "$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)")/.worktrees/feature-<name>" origin/develop
   ```

2. The primary/root checkout remains on `develop`. Never check out feature branches at the root.

## 4. Working a Change

1. Start the feature branch using `git-flow-next`:

   ```bash
   git flow feature start <name>
   ```

   *Note*: The CLI automatically prepends `feature/`. Pass only the descriptive slug (including issue number if it exists), e.g., `123-fix-inventory-loader`.
2. Commit atomically following Conventional Commits, referencing the issue (`#123`).
3. Open the PR targeting `develop`. Squash-merge feature PRs.
4. **Validation**: Thoroughly test and validate the merged code on `develop` before production promotion.

## 5. Mandatory Promotion to Production

"Promotion is a step you take, not an event that happens."

Feature PRs squash into `develop` and stop there. To release them:

1. Before finishing a session, verify if `develop` has unpromoted commits:

   ```bash
   git log origin/main..origin/develop
   ```

2. If commits exist, run `/promote-release` to open/reuse a `develop` -> `main` PR and merge it using a **merge commit** (`--merge` flag on `gh pr merge`).
   Never squash or rebase into `main`.
3. Merging triggers `release-please` on `main`, which automatically cuts the release, version bump, and tag.
4. **Planning Reminder**: You must add "Merge develop into main" to your session checklist/to-do list at planning time.
