description: Use when installing or choosing CLI tools in a Nix flake repo, editing flake.nix or home-manager config, or when tempted to pip/pipx/uv/brew/npm install anything. Tools come from the dev shell or nix shell — never ad-hoc package managers.

# Nix Tool Policy

## Rule: Never Install Tools That Nix Dev Shells Provide

**Scope**: All repositories with `flake.nix` + `.envrc` (Nix dev shell pattern)

## Prohibited Actions

- `pipx install <tool>` / `pipx reinstall <tool>` — pipx virtualenvs reference Nix store Python; breaks after GC
- `pip install <tool>` / `pip3 install <tool>` — same problem, also pollutes global Python
- `uv pip install <tool>` — same Nix store Python problem
- `uv run <tool>` — generally unnecessary in Nix dev shells; prefer bare commands from the dev shell PATH.
  Last-resort package runner (with confirmation) only when the dev shell does not provide the tool.
- `brew install <tool>` for tools already in the dev shell — creates version conflicts

## What To Do Instead

1. **Tools are on PATH**: When a repo has `flake.nix` + `.envrc`, all project tools are provided by the Nix dev shell. Run them as bare commands.

2. **If a tool is not found**: Use `direnv exec . <command>` to run within the dev shell environment. This works even when direnv shell hooks haven't fired.

3. **If direnv exec fails**: Use `nix develop --command <command>` as a fallback. This is slower but always works.

4. **If the tool truly isn't in the flake**: Prefer adding the tool to `flake.nix` so it becomes part of the dev shell.
   For one-off usage, run it via `nix shell -p <tool>` rather than installing with pipx/pip/uv.

5. **Never install globally**: Do not respond to a missing tool by installing it system-wide with pipx/pip/uv/brew;
   use the dev shell or a temporary Nix invocation, and update `flake.nix` when the tool is needed long term.

## Nix-Specific Alternatives

| Task | Use This | Not This |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Config generation | Nix functions (`lib.mkIf`, `lib.generators.*`) | Shell/Python generator |
| Nix data processing | `builtins.fromJSON`, `builtins.readFile`, `lib.strings.*` | Python wrapper |

## Nix Script Patterns

When a Nix script IS needed (committed artifact):

- Use `writeShellApplication` with `runtimeInputs`, reference via `${./<relative-path>}`
- For inline Nix wrappers: one-liner `exec` patterns in `writeShellScriptBin` are acceptable

## Why This Matters

Nix manages Python interpreters in the Nix store (`/nix/store/...`).
Tools installed via pipx/pip create virtual environments that hardcode paths to these interpreters.
When `nix-collect-garbage` runs or a flake update changes the Python version,
those paths become invalid and every pipx/pip-installed tool breaks silently.

The Nix dev shell pattern avoids this by providing tools through the flake lockfile, ensuring consistent, reproducible environments that survive garbage collection.

## Repos Using This Pattern

All JacobPEvans repositories with `flake.nix` + `.envrc`, including:

- ansible-proxmox, ansible-proxmox-apps, ansible-splunk
- terraform-proxmox, terraform-aws, terraform-aws-bedrock
- nix-darwin, nix-ai, nix-home, nix-devenv
- orbstack-kubernetes
